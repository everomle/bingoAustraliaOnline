																The Game Server Starts a New game by selecting the Game pattern for the next game. The Game server enables player card purchasing. The Players manually select their game cards from a deck of over 30,000 unique bingo cards. Players purchase their desired cards. The purchase requests are sent to the game server. The game server receives the purchase requests from the players and enters their selected cards into the game. The server sends an acknowledgement back to the player telling the player that their cards have been purchased, and entered into the game, 25 Seconds before game start time the game server suspends further card purchasing. The game server waits an additional 15 seconds to make sure that all purchase requests have been completed and properly entered into the system. The game server then generates 75 or 90 numbers using the systems random number generator. The game server then systematically applies the random calls to each of the player purchased bingo cards and crosschecks each card with the winning pattern. With this procedure the game server has now determined the number of winning bingo cards in the deck of player purchased cards and at which call the cards have won. Receives this information and begins calling the numbers. Calls are presented to the user every ten seconds. Players can then play and chat with other players knowing that in the event of any system, or telecommunications interruption their cards have been fairly entered into the game and that in each case the true game winner (or winners) will be awarded the prize. The outline provided here shows that our game system is fair and completely random. Players are presented with random cards, which they can select at random. The 75 or 90 calls for the game are generated randomly AFTER the card sales have closed. The only factor that enters into determining a winner is the cards that players select on their own. There are no external or internal factors that assist or deter people from winning - it is purely a combination of card selection strategy and luck. Players are always credited with wins regardless of program or network problems during a game in progress.

																Players must use all bonus bucks within 15 days of their last deposit. Any bonus that has not been used prior to this date will expire. Check out section 4 below for specific expiration times on specific bonuses.

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Players that have not logged in and have not deposited in 180 days or more, will have their account disabled.

																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Players should be aware that where we believe that the bonus system is being abused or manipulated by a player, or where we believe that a player has exceeded a reasonable total bonus maximum for a defined period (taking into account all bonuses awarded) we reserve the right to make adjustments up to the total value of chat credits and misc. comps in the players account, or to impose a temporary bonus maximum award limit on the account.
															</p>

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Player accounts found to be abusing our bonus system will be closed immediately in all networks and any payout will be null and void.
															</p>

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Courtesy bonuses and other non deposit bonus are rare and we are not obligated in any way to credit them, but if we do credit a courtesy bonus it should be considered play money and any winnings generated from it cannot be withdrawn.
															</p>

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Every deposit automatically gets a bonus, we cannot accept your deposit without giving you the bonus.
															</p>

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																If a player request the bonus to be deducted from their account, the bonus cannot be credited back afterwards AND bonus amount will still be included for wagering purposes. We do not offer the option to deposit with no bonuses, this is due to wagering rules.
															</p>

															<p>
																<img src="images/double-right-alt.png" alt="double right alt"/> 
																Players with ratio 90% or more are not eligible to receive any free bonuses or special bonuses offered otherwise indicated.
